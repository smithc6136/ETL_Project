# ETL_Project

**Project Title:** World Happiness Reports 2018 and 2019
**Team Members:** Catherine Smith, Grant Leach, Tomorrow Rose



**Project Description:** For this project, we will be analyzing World Happiness data from two csv files found on Kaggle. Our analysis will involve extracting, transforming, and loading the data into a database.



**Data Cleanup & Analysis:**

Data source: https://www.kaggle.com/mathurinache/world-happiness-report

Transformation needed: We will clean our data with pandas in a jupyter notebook and then perform joins and filtering with SQL.

Final production database: Relational

The final tables or collections that will be used in the production database will include side by side comparisons of different metrics (overall rank, score GDP per capita, generosity, etc.) for each country for the years 2018 and 2019.

Our final technical report will include the above information and steps required to reproduce the ETL process.



Rough Breakdown of Tasks:
    We will each be submitting the github link to BCS.
    During class, we will be sharing one screen to complete the required task.
